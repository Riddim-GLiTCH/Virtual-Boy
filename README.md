## Why did you make this theme?
This is my first ever properly finished Discord theme. I made it cuz I was working on a previous theme with an ex partner of mine, but that project died off due to a breakup. I really wanted to make my own theme though, so I set out to make this.

So far, I've been having a blast working on this. I'm learning a lot of new things, and I feel pretty positive in the Discord Theming community.

## Can I modify this theme for personal use?
Yes, BUT. if you want to publish it, I kindly ask of you to link back to this repository, and make sure people know it's based off this. Also make sure the credits below are clearly shown!

## Contribution?
Yes please! Help is always appreciated! Just make a [pull request][pulls], or let me know what I should add/fix in [issues][issues]!
